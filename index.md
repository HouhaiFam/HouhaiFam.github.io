## Welcome to my webpage!

My name's Brandon Pozil and I'm currently in the Computer Science Program at UNCG! I also have a prior degree from UNCG that was a BS in Business Administration with a focus on Managerial Studies.

I'm looking to get as involved with the program and in the field of software engineering and computer science as soon as I possibly can!

I'm currently the Secretary for the Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) as well as a member of the Information Security Club in the Computer Science department!

And [here](http://github.com/HouhaiFam) is my Github account which I am in the process of populating with some of my coursework and side projects.

### Relevant Coursework

I'm currently taking CSC 330 (Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms) and we are going over Binary Search Trees as well as some basic heaps. I'm also taking CSC 250 (Foundations of Computer Science II), which essentially covers the logic behind making sure our algorithms work properly and as they should be. First order predicate calculus and Conjunctive and Disjunctive Normal Forms are just a few of the litany of things we've gone over so far. Lastly, I'm in CSC 261 (Computer Organization and Assembly Language), a fascinating class about learning the 1's and 0's of how our programs work from a level just above actual Machine Code. All these classes are incredibly difficult but incredibly rewarding as well. The challenge excites me and I can't wait to see what else is left in store for us! 


### Prior Coursework
##CSC 130- Introduction to Java

I didn't actually take this class but studied the Java documentation and tested out of the class, thus allowing me to jump right into the next stage of the program. This class focused on Java syntax and basic structures such as for loops, while and do while loops, if statements and the like.

##CSC 230- Elementary Data Structures and Algorithms

Going over basic arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues as well as sorting algorithms and asymptotic analysis.

##CSC 250- Foundations of Computer Science I

Introduction to set theory and a lot of logic problems and proofs. Also went over certain functions and algorithms like the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm and hashing.


### Fun Facts
I'm very experienced in Java, have some basic C experience, a little Python and I'm pretty well versed in a web testing framework called Selenium. 

I like to play guitar in my freetime. I have a seven and six string guitar at home and play almost daily.
